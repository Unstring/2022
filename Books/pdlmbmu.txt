I am Just a Sole whose Intentions are good, OO Lord please don't let me be misundrestood,

People don't you Know that i am only human.

sometimes i feel is all worry.

people do you understand me now.

things go wrong seems a little sad.

sometimes i am so carefree that joy is 

sometimes i feel alone regrating 

I am just someone whose intentions are good.
